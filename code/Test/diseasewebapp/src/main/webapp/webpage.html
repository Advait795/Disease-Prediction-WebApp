            <p>We are employing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of an individual having a disease.
                This model analyzes patterns in various data points, such as symptoms, medical history, and other
                relevant factors, to make its predictions. This method aims to detect diseases early, thereby enhancing
                the chances of successful treatment and improving overall health outcomes.
